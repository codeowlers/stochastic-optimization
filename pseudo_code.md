## 3. Reinforcement learning

#### This problem is an example of a `dynamic lot-sizing and scheduling problem (DLSP)`, which is a type of optimization problem commonly encountered in production planning. The objective is to minimize the total cost, which is composed of the inventory cost, the lost sales cost, and the setup cost.

#### A possible methodology to solve this problem would be to use a `mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach`.
#### This involves formulating the problem as a mathematical model, with decision variables representing the choices made for each machine and for each time period, and constraints representing the relationships between the variables and the problem constraints. The objective function can then be optimized using a suitable MILP solver.

### Here are the steps to formulating a MILP model for the DLSP:

- Define decision variables:
  - For each machine and each time period, define a binary decision variable xi,m,t that indicates whether machine m is producing item i during time t.
  - For each item and each time period, define a continuous decision variable Ii,t that represents the inventory of item i at time t.
  - For each item and each time period, define a continuous decision variable zi,t that represents the lost sales of item i at time t.
  - For each item, machine, and each time period, define a binary decision variable δi,m,t that indicates whether machine m has done a setup between time t - 1 and time t.
- Formulate the constraints:
  - Constraints representing the relationships between the decision variables:
    - For each item, machine, and each time period, the production constraint: `Ii,t+1 - zi,t = Ii,t + pi,m * xi,m,t - ci * δi,m,t`
    - For each item and each time period, the lost sales constraint: `zi,t >= di,t - Ii,t`
    - For each machine and each time period, the machine utilization constraint: `X(xi,m,t) <= 1`
    - Constraints representing the problem constraints:
    - For each item and each time period, the inventory constraint: `0 <= Ii,t <= I_upper`
    - For each item and each time period, the lost sales constraint: `0 <= zi,t <= di,t`
    - For each item, machine, and each time period, the setup constraint: `δi,m,t <= xi,m,t`
    - For each machine and each time period, the binary constraint for `xi,m,t`: `xi,m,t in {0, 1}`
- For each item, machine, and each time period, the binary constraint for `δi,m,t`: `δi,m,t in {0, 1}`
- Formulate the objective function:
  - The objective function is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the inventory cost, the lost sales cost, and the setup cost: `min(Σ(hi * Ii,t) + Σ(l * zi,t) + Σ(f * δi,m,t))`
  
- Solve the model using a suitable MILP solver to obtain the optimal solution.

  - This is a general outline of the methodology to solve the DLSP. Depending on the specific problem, additional constraints or variables may be necessary, and the mathematical formulation may need to be modified accordingly
